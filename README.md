This is an attempt at making a pretty minimal portfolio website in React, I'm hoping to construct this in a couple of different ways to understand some other frameworks too like Next.js, Vue.js and Angular.js

The aim is to make something clean looking with a few visual flourishes and a reactive design depending on the interface/ view port of the user.
